      "context": "Deep house emphasizes atmosphere and groove over energy. This progression uses minor keys and seventh chords to create a sophisticated, after-hours club vibe. The slower harmonic rhythm and use of suspended chords creates a hypnotic, soulful quality. Artists like Larry Heard, Kerri Chandler, and Moodymann use these jazz-influenced progressions. The depth comes from harmonic sophistication, not complexity.",

The real complexity is in the clave rhythm (3-2 or 2-3) that governs all other instruments. Pianists play montuno patterns over these changes while timbales, congas, and bongos create interlocking rhythms. Authentic salsa prioritizes rhythm over harmonic complexity.",

This progression in D minor demonstrates typical samba changes with the characteristic ii-V-i in minor. The use of altered dominants (A7b9) and the movement through relative major (F major) creates the sophisticated yet danceable quality.

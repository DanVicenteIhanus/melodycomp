# Genre: Shoegaze

## Characteristics
- **Tempo**: Slow-to-uptempo, typically 100-160 BPM.
- **Rhythm**: Drums are typically simple, driving, and repetitive (often from a Roland TR-77 or similar drum machine), serving as an anchor beneath the chaos. The rhythm section is often buried in the mix.
- **Mood**: Dreamy, ethereal, introspective, melancholic, and often overwhelmingly loud.
- **Guitars/Sound**: The defining element is the "wall of sound." Guitars are heavily processed with layers of fuzz, reverb, delay, and chorus. Lead vocals are often low in the mix, treated as another textural instrument.

## Common Chord Progressions
- Often uses simple major and minor chord progressions, with complexity arising from texture and dissonance rather than harmonic intricacy.
- Droning, sustained chords and open tunings are common.
- Examples: `I–VI–V` (e.g., `G-D-Em-C`), `vi-IV-I-V` (e.g., `Am-F-C-G`).

## Key Artists & Albums
- My Bloody Valentine ("Loveless")
- Slowdive ("Souvlaki")
- Ride ("Nowhere")
- Lush ("Spooky")
- Cocteau Twins ("Heaven or Las Vegas")
- Ulrich Schnauss ("On My Own")

## Production Tips & Tricks
- Layer many guitar tracks, some heavily distorted and others clean with effects, and pan them wide to create the "wall of sound."
- Use the "reverse reverb" effect on guitars, a hallmark of the genre.
- Mix vocals low and wash them out with their own reverb and delay.
- The bassline should be melodic and simple, holding down the root notes to ground the song.
- Play with minor/major progressions to make ambiguous progressions, e.g melodies in major and bassline following a minor pentatonic progression. 
- Compress the drum bus heavily to make it punch through the dense guitar layers without overpowering them.

## Additional Description

```Learn the major scale patterns, and be able to identify the notes in the scale. This will help you learn the fretboard.

The notes in the scale (the key of C major for example is C, D, E, F, G, A, B) will correspond with the chords that generally always sound good together. I’ll keep referencing C major because it doesn’t have any sharp or flat notes.

For chords in a key you will often see them referred to as i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, or the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7th. These correspond with the notes in the scale (in C major C = 1, D = 2, etc). As a rule of thumb the i, iv, and v will be the major chords. ii, iii, and vi are minor. vii is diminished. Using that you can know what chords will sound good together in any key. Common progressions are i-iv-v, i-vi-v-iv, and so on. Play with them and have fun.

Scale wise, after I learned the pentatonic patterns I moved on to learning the modes to extend them and add different flavours. I don’t think about them much though, I learned by ear listening to a lot of Dinosaur jr, learning the modes was more to make sense of what I was playing vs learning what to play.

In shoegaze you will see a lot of add9th chords (add the note 2 frets up to the chord’s root, eg: Cadd9 adds a D) and maj7 chords (add the note 1 fret down from the chords root, eg: Cmaj7 adds a B). I also like power chords where the B and high E string are left open. Move the shapes around and you will find what works really quickly.

Anyway, that’s a bit of the basics of general music theory. There is a lot more to know, and even more to the topics I mentioned in my Coles notes above, it’s just to give you the gist of things. In all honesty, you could probably figure out some cool stuff on your own with 0 theory. Lots of the coolest sounds ever came from people who didn’t know what they were doing twisting their tuning pegs a bit.

# Genre: Trip-Hop

## Characteristics
- **Tempo**: Slow, typically 60-90 BPM.
- **Mood**: Moody, melancholic, atmospheric, often dark.
- **Rhythm**: Breakbeats sampled from old funk, jazz, and soul records. Rhythms are often syncopated but simple, loopy and hypnotic. Drum sounds are typically lo-fi, dusty, and compressed.
- **Basslines**: Deep, dub-inspired, and simple. Often uses notes from the minor pentatonic or natural minor scales. Repetitive and groovy.

## Common Chord Progressions
- Minor key progressions are dominant.
- Examples: `i-VI-iv-v` (e.g., `Cm - Ab - Fm - Gm`), `i-iv-v` (e.g., `Am - Dm - Em`).
- Often uses jazzy or extended chords like minor 7ths.

## Key Artists & Albums
- Portishead ("Dummy")
- Massive Attack ("Blue Lines", "Mezzanine")
- Tricky ("Maxinquaye")
- Dj Shadow ("Midnight In a Perfect World")
- RJD2 ("Deadringer")
- DJ Cam ("Mad Blunted Jazz") 

## Production Tips & Tricks
- Use vinyl crackle and other atmospheric noise to create texture.
- Use a lot of samples from old records. Can be short snippets used as fx etc. 
- Side-chain compression on bass and pads from the kick drum is very common to enhance the groove.
- Reverb should be dark and spacious.

## Further Description
```So, I listen to a lot of trip-hop - 26% of my overall listening, according to spotify.me, more than any other genre. The only problem is, I've never been exactly sure what it is.

So, if you're at all familiar with the genre, you probably know that it started in Bristol in the 90s, when a cast of musical miscreants got high as shit on MDMA and started mixing some downtempo hip hop beats with jazz samples and the result had a spiritual baby with Siouxsie and the Banshees. The only problem is, the originators of the genre, widely considered to be its core defining acts - Massive Attack, Portishead, Tricky, and DJ Shadow [EDIT: DJ Shadow is disputed, see comments below] - don't really sound a hell of a lot like each other. Also, there's the small fact that none of those performers advertised themselves with that logo, and in fact, mostly they rejected it. Beth Gibbons once said that there really was no "Bristol sound." Martina Topley-Bird expressly rejected the term. And Tricky supposedly used to yell out at shows, "Who loves trip-hop?" - and when people said "Yes!" he'd yell back "Well fuck you then!"

So, what defines it? A distinctly trashy-emphatic drum sound seems to be part of it. It's definitely downtempo. Vocalists are typically female, but two of the key core acts, Massive Attack and Tricky, problematize that. It's complex and multi-layered. And... maybe that's it? It's also kind of an atmosphere, though, and a dark one. Trip-hop is virtually never upbeat and certainly never cheerful. Brooding, sinister, sexy, melancholy, wistful, dreamy, and depressed are the moods at which it excels.

If I had to describe it in terms of what I think it "does" as music - really, what I find attractive about it, and what I think draws in most fans - is that it's chill music with no chill. It's electronica for people who don't want to hit the dance floor but do want to stay mentally alert. Its closest literary/cinematic genre analogue is suspense - it doesn't break out into violent action, but maintains a sense of tension.

So, I guess my first question is, does this description work? Did I miss something? Is this even useful as a genre classification, or is it a mode, a tone, a tendency, that certain artists happen to have specialized in, but that doesn't make it meaningfully different from "downtempo electronica" in general?

And the second (and maybe more important) question is: Who's in and who's out? Certain acts seems universally included: The above-mentioned four, of course (Massive Attack, Portishead, Tricky, DJ Shadow); Lamb, Bonobo, Nightmares on Wax, Thievery Corporation, and U.N.K.L.E. Also Bowery Electric, and Hooverphonic, at least the first album. Sneaker Pimps and Zero 7 are almost universally included except I personally consider them marginal cases, too bright-toned to fit strictly (Sneaker Pimps are basically the bridge between trip-hop and pop, Zero 7 I just think of as "downtempo").

Then you start to get into some odder cases. I've seen Poe, Bitter:Sweet, Pati Yang, Terranova, and 8mm all labelled "trip hop." Some of them incorporate trip-hop elements (Poe, Bitter:Sweet) into a sound that wouldn't otherwise fit the genre. In other cases, it's a fling. Seriously, hang around any trip-hop-related space on the internet and you will soon find yourself being recommended "Give it Up" by 8mm, off Songs to Love and Die By. It's a fantastic song that kills the trip-hop vibe 100%. Problem is, it's a fluke. The rest of the album is 100% alt-rock.```

# Genre: Detroit Techno

## Characteristics
- **Tempo**: Faster and more driving than house, typically 125-140 BPM.
- **Mood**: Futuristic, sci-fi, melancholic yet soulful, and often industrial. Reflects a theme of "techno-soul" â€“ the relationship between humanity and machines.
- **Rhythm**: Built on the TR-808, TR-909 and TR-707, but patterns are often more syncopated and complex than in house music. The 909 ride cymbal is a key driving element.
- **Synths**: Characterized by sci-fi synth pads, atmospheric strings (Roland Juno-106), and futuristic melodic leads.

## Common Chord Progressions
- Typically uses melancholic, minor-key progressions or pentatonic scales that evoke a sense of space and futurism.
- Synth stabs using string and brass sounds are very common.
- Examples: `i-VI-III-VII` (e.g., `Cm - Ab - Eb - Bb`), use of minor 9th and suspended chords to create a "spacey" atmosphere.

## Production Tips & Tricks
- Layer different melodic synth parts: a deep bassline, wide atmospheric pads, and a central melodic lead.
- Automate the filter cutoff (frequency) on your synths throughout the track to create movement and evolution.
- Use stereo delay and reverb to create a sense of deep space, but keep the kick, snare, and bass relatively dry and centered.
- The interplay between melodic, soulful elements and the raw, repetitive machine rhythm is key.
- Don't be afraid of dissonance; use it to create tension.

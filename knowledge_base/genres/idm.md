## Further Description

```Intelligent Dance Music, most commonly known as IDM, is a term invented in the early 1990s to describe the sound of a number of electronic musicians who sought to develop dance music beyond the clubs and more into the realm of home listening. The term itself has been the subject of intense criticism, with many citing the "Intelligent" portion as elitist in nature. Aphex Twin, an artist frequently cited as a pioneer of the scene, stated in a 1997 interview: “I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying 'this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.' It's really nasty to everyone else's music.” Regardless of the arguments surrounding its label, many acts enjoyed a strong underground following after the inception of the term, with Sheffield’s Warp Records introducing acts like Autechre, The Orb’s Dr. Alex Paterson, and B12 on its famed Artificial Intelligence compilation, as well as a number of artists who would enjoy critical acclaim during the second half of the decade, such as Boards of Canada and Prefuse 73.

By the mid-nineties, IDM’s style tended to veer away from the Techno and House sound that inspired it, with a number of the key figures either choosing to go further down the path of experimentation or employing a much more beat-focused approach to their work. Squarepusher, another one of Warp’s biggest names, combined his typically reckless style of Drum and Bass with a number of techniques more commonly found on Jazz Fusion records, further stretching IDM as a useful descriptor of a particular sound, and making it more of an umbrella term. Attempts have been made to alter the name of the genre and shake off the negative connotations, with Aphex Twin’s “braindance” description of his own music and Warp’s “electronic listening music” proving somewhat popular. Regardless, IDM remains a strong modern scene, with artists like Richard Devine and Arovane continuing this often difficult-to-define style of music.
